//! Generational-index allocator: issues [`GenerationalIndex`] handles that
//! detect their own staleness after the slot they point at gets freed and
//! reused.
//!
//! Not from the C++ prior-art list `docs/mid-collections.md` otherwise
//! draws on -- this is the Rust ecosystem's own well-established answer
//! (`slotmap`, `generational-arena`) to a problem that shows up the
//! moment IDs can be freed and their slots reused: a stale handle held
//! from before a free must not silently alias whatever new thing got
//! allocated into that same slot. Fix: pair each slot with a generation
//! counter, bumped on every occupied↔vacant transition, and every handle
//! carries the generation it was issued with. A handle whose generation
//! no longer matches the slot's current one is caught as dead, not
//! aliased.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! This is `mid-ecs`'s entity-ID allocator -- `World::spawn`/`despawn`
//! are a thin wrapper over this, see `docs/mid-ecs.md`. Deliberately
//! **does not store a value per slot** the way `slotmap::SlotMap<K, V>`
//! or `generational_arena::Arena<T>` do: real ECS implementations
//! (`hecs`, `bevy_ecs` -- checked their actual entity-allocation code,
//! not assumed) both roll their own value-less allocator rather than
//! reusing a generic value-storing slotmap crate, because entity
//! component data lives in per-component storage
//! ([`crate::SparseSet`] today, the Archetype Core later) keyed *by*
//! the entity, not stored *in* the allocator itself. Building the
//! heavier value-storing version here would solve a problem `mid-ecs`
//! doesn't have.
//!
//! # Design, verified against real `slotmap` 1.0.7 source, not assumed
//!
//! The core trick -- one `u32` generation counter per slot, where **even
//! means vacant and odd means occupied** -- is `slotmap`'s own real,
//! shipped design (`src/basic.rs`: `version: u32, // Even = vacant, odd
//! = occupied.`), not derived from a blog post or invented independently.
//! Bumping generation on *every* transition (not just on free) means a
//! stale key's generation can never coincidentally match the slot's
//! current one after a reuse, and it gives a free `is_occupied` check
//! (`generation % 2 == 1`) with no separate `bool` field needed.
//!
//! The free list itself needs no `u32::MAX`-style sentinel, for the same
//! reason `slotmap`'s doesn't: `free_head` pointing *past the end* of
//! `slots` (i.e. `free_head == slots.len()`) already means "nothing to
//! reuse, grow instead" for free, via a plain `Vec::get` returning
//! `None`. One divergence from `slotmap`, deliberate: it also unions
//! each slot's storage between the live value and the free-list pointer
//! (`unsafe`, to avoid paying for both at once). Nothing here stores a
//! value, so there's no such union to build in the first place -- this
//! stays plain, safe Rust throughout, no `unsafe`, matching
//! [`crate::SparseSet`]'s own precedent that raw-pointer tricks wait for
//! a real, profiled need rather than being built speculatively.
//!
//! Reuse order is LIFO (most-recently-freed slot is the next one
//! reused) -- also matching `slotmap`, and a reasonable default for
//! cache behavior (a just-freed slot's memory is more likely to still be
//! hot).
//!
//! `generation.wrapping_add(1)` on free, not a checked/panicking add:
//! copied deliberately from `slotmap`'s own choice. After exactly
//! 2^32 reuse cycles on one single slot, generation wraps back to a
//! value that could theoretically alias an ancient handle -- accepted
//! as-is here the same way `slotmap` accepts it in production, rather
//! than second-guessing a battle-tested crate's own considered trade-off.
